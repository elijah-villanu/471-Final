# 471 Final Project Submission
## To Compline and Run
With VS CODE on Windows:

## Controls
Camera control
W - A - S - D: Forward, left, backward, right
Mouse Scroll (AS INSTRUCTED FROM PITCH AND YAW LAB 8). Trackpad would work best
G: Cinematic view, only works once

## Code Explanations
Please note, I was not able to implement particles, but my code is present (drawMe is just commented out). It was working in lab 9 (and was demoed) but for some reason when I was trying to implement it here it wasn't working and would crash with no errors. Any feedback on a fix would be appreciated.
